                "If anyone had told me three years ago that I would be spending most of my weekends camping. I would have laughed heartily. Campers, in my eyes, were people who enjoyed insects bites, ill-cooked meals, and uncomfortable sleeping bags. They had nothing in common with me. <Q36> The friends who introduced me to camping thought that it meant to be a pioneer. <Q37> We sleep in a tent, cooked over an open fire, and walked a long distance to take the shower and use the bathroom. This brief visit with Mother Nature cost me two days off from work, recovering from a bad case of sunburn and the doctor's bill for my son's food poisoning. I was, nevertheless, talked into going on another fun-filled holiday in the wilderness. <Q38> Instead, we had a pop-up camper with comfortable beds and an air conditioner. My nature-loving friends had remembered to bring all the necessities of life. <Q39> We have done a lot of it since. Recently, we bought a twenty-eight-foot travel trailer complete with a bathroom and a built-in TV set. There is a separate bedroom, a modern kitchen with a refrigerator. The trailer even has matching carpet and curtains. <Q40> It must be true that sooner or later, everyone finds his or her way back to nature. I recommend that you find your way in style. \nWhat should be filled in at the <Q36> position? \"This time there was no tent.\", \"Things are going to be improved.\", \"The trip they took me on was a rough one.\", \"I was to learn a lot about camping since then, however.\", \"I must say that I have certainly come to enjoy camping.\", \"After the trip, my family became quite interested in camping.\" or \"There was no shade as the trees were no more than 3 feet tall.\"?\nI was to learn a lot about camping since then, however.\n",
