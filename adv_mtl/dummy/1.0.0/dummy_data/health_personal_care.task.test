1	such a thoughtful gift . a real treat for those of us living in colder climates - especially in the winter . the warm lotion is truly a treat to dry , itchy winter skin . anyone would love this !
1	this is very soothing for people with arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel wonderful
1	i tried all the possible creams on the market , cheap and expensive , for my dark circles but this is the only one that worked imediately . i can not live without it , this is a keeper . it stings a little bit , not all the time but it does . it says that it should only be used twice a day but if i 've had a really tiring week and i 'm in a rush to look good i use it up to five six times a day , just a tiny film and with 2 hours between them . i guarantee that in three days you 'll not recognize yourself ( in a good way ) . very important : it tends to dry the skin under the eyes very much so be sure to aplly after a very good cream ( i use pure chamomile cream ) and leave it over night . well , follow my recipe and you 'll shine fast , you 'll see
1	i have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and i find it to be accurate , but it takes a while for it to give a reading . the first few times i used it , it took over a minute to tell me my pulse . however , the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster . so far , this is true , as within the last 3 days , i have received readings within 10 seconds consistently . considering the price , it was a good purchase
1	i have used olay regenerist perfecting cream for over a year now . it leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely . it does not have spf protection so for daytime i use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation . at night it 's all you need
