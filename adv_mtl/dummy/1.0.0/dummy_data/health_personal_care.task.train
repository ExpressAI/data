1	after going back and forth between oil of olay and neutrogena i settled on this product mostly because of the price ( plus no one complained about the granules getting into their eyes . ) i 'm happy with the results- my skin is softer and appears to have taken on more clarity . the orange smell is lovely and it only takes two minutes ( i do it in the shower . ) of course , it 's not microdermabrasian , but it is a great exfolliater for your skin
0	i had great results with this product with the first use . however , when i used it the second time , the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface , leaving me with a smooth , useless triangle . i replaced the triangle , thinking i had a `` dud '' , but had the same thing happen with the second pad . the cream will work without the pad , but not as effectively . if the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface , they will have a winner with this product . on a positive note , i love the facial product
0	it 's quality is cheap and poorly made . i bought two thinking it was a good deal but i threw them out after 2 days because the on/off switch did n't work . it was also very loud
1	i really like this product . it 's very dry and windy here and my lips have been very chapped . the neutrogena has helped 100 % when nothing else worked ! ! i 'll definitely buy this product !
0	i was disappointed getting this product because i 've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron . i actually prefer the cheaper conair 's ceremanic irons w/o the wet on/off feature over this one . it does n't clamp down well on my hair ( i 've got thick frizzy hair ) . the results for me are n't that great , it straightens my hair a little but it 's still frizzy . it 's lightweight which is nice . i do n't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair . i definitely prefer other models over this one .
