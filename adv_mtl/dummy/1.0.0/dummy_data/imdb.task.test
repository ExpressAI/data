1	this film is a masterpiece to put it simply .  especially the double exposure made by the cameraman julius jaenzon .  it is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today seventy eight years later .  viktor sjöström ,  the director ,  also plays the main character ,  david holm .  on the night of new years eve he is killed in a fight ,  and the legend says that the first one who dies on the new year ,  will have to work as a soul-collector in the form of a transparent ghost .  there is a new soul-collector to be appointed every year .   the scene in which the alcoholic ,  david holm ,  rises up from his dead body  ( like the soul is leaving his earthly body )  in the churchyard  ( where the fight took place )  is a real award for a filmloving eye .  also when the present soul-collector arrives with his horse and carriage is a beautiful but also a scary scene .  david holm recognizes this soul-collector as a drinkingfriend from earlier life .  it is now his turn to take over .  just like scrooge in dickens story  " a christmas tale "  ,  david is shown what his life and doings has led to for the people around him .   the film is about the danger of abusing drugs ,  in this case alcohol .  it is based upon a book by nobel prize winner selma lagerlöf .  viktor sjöström filmed a few more of her books ,  but this is the one with the best outcome ,  maybe because this book is the most filmic of them .   
0	this movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible .  the plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end i wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen .   normally i don't write reviews ,  but i was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got .  while i admit that the acting was okay at some parts ,  the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting .  the only reason i watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it ,  introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made ,  judging by the trailer .  we were not disappointed in the least .  its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line :   brandon :  i just want to get to know you .   girl :  you just want to get into my pants .   brandon :  i want to get into your mind ,  your heart ,  your soul .  i don't see you wearing any pants in this equation .   overall ,  i would rate this movie as the worst movie i ever saw that took itself seriously . 
0	that this film has such a low imdb rating is not surprising .  in our post-enron era ,  do we really need any more reminders of america's obsession with the greed creed ?  the topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort ,  but will respond with barely concealed rage .  it was all i could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the dvd and smashing it into a thousand pieces .   what's really irksome with these kinds of films ,  including  " purpose "  ,  is their pretense that behind the glitter ,  there's some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile .  in  " purpose "  ,  i found no such meaningful message .  what i did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth .  the two main characters ,  nauseating in their glibness ,  do very little actual work .  instead ,  they party ,  they play golf ,  they strut their coolness ,  they sound  " hip "  with dialogue straight out of mtv-culture-speak :   " rock my world "  ,  and  " now get back to partying ;  that's an order "  .  john is smug ,  self-important ,  shallow ,  and smirks a lot .  robert ,  who wears funky little glasses ,  is even worse .   the film includes two youthful garage geeks ,  who look and sound like they're right out of the film  " antitrust "   ( 2001 )  .  stereotypes are played for all they're worth ,  and in this film also include chic-looking computer equipment ,  and barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can-do future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy-duty partying .  and with the time-bound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates ,  can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years ?   about the best i can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of san francisco .  the film would have been a lot more enjoyable ,  a lot more entertaining ,  if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story ,  and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the film's duration . 
0	this  " film ,  "  and i use that term loosely ,  reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote ,  at eighteen months :   " p . u .  ,  stinky poopies !  "    like that joke ,  this movie can only appeal to the very young ,  the very immature ,  or the very stupid .    that said ,  there are a few bright spots .    the effects ,  where the majority of the reputed $100 million went ,  are kinetic and convincing -- i mean ,  as convincing as those kind of kinetic cgi effects can be .  the cgi baby effects are not great ,  but i imagine those are very hard to do well .  .  .  although for a hundred-million bucks ,  they could have been better !   moose ,  the dog from  " frasier ,  "  phoned in his usual exemplary performance .  steven wright did well with a small part .  alan cummings was ,  well ,  alan cummings-as-villain ,  which we've seen before ,  and bob hoskins as odin was unrecognizable ,  but enjoyable .    the actress playing mrs .  avery was cute-as-a-button ,  as you'd expect ,  and jamie kennedy stunk ,  as you'd expect .  his best role so far was in the scream trilogy  ( not to be confused with the lord of the rings trilogy )  ,  and in three kings .  he should stick ,  perhaps ,  to more subtle forms of comedy .  jim carrey ,  he ain't .   the writing and direction were ,  if anything ,  worse than kennedy's performance .  i semi-remember one clever  ( though seven-year-old clever )  line that i wish someone would quote accurately for the  " memorable quotes "  section .  something about avery's proposed costume being the  " crappiest crap in craptown ,  "  it was a second-grade joke ,  but sort of funny in context .   over all ,  since there's nothing lower than a  " one ,  "  i give this film a  " one .
