1	the bourne ultimatum  ( 2007 )  review :  after a thrilling set of two ,  we get the final installment .  here's my take :   the bourne ultimatum has it all .  we have jason bourne ( matt damon )  on the coattails of the ones who know everything .  he has been running for too long .  this time ,  it ends .   the bourne ultimatum has a great plot ,  awesome writing ,  fantastic direction ,  suspense ,  and some of the best action of the summer .  matt damon delivers possibly his best performance to date .  he has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin .   there are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense .  the reactions to certain events will have you either laughing ( in a good way )  or cheering on .   ( or both )  i heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping .  the audience was loving it .   the bourne ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package .  all of the goods and then some .  this is ,  in my opinion the best movie this summer .   the last word :  excellent conclusion .  the best of the trilogy .  this is how summer movie thrillers should be done .  i love the bourne trilogy . 
1	hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr .  sebastian caine  ( kevin bacon )  finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum .  they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly ,  caine & his team of assistant's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human .  he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible ,  however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible .  the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works ,  caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory .  but then again he's invisible right ,  he can do anything he wants .  .  .   directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man .  you know it's just after christmas ,  i saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick ,  not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief .  the script by andrew w .  marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise ,  it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man  ( 1933 )  film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit .  it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror ,  sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes .  i thought the character's were ok ,  i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it's generally known that verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety ,  the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that caine says to himself .  then of course there's the gore ,  he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits ,  to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it .  having said that i love horror/gore/exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me ,  it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea .   director verhoeven does a great job ,  or should that be the special effects boys make him look good .  the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless ,  their brilliant & it's as simple & straight forward as that .  there's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top .  i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins ,  organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla .  there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten ,  someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results .   with a staggering budget of about $95 , 000 , 000 hollow man is technically faultless ,  i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they ?  the acting was ok ,  bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy .   hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film ,  well i know i do .  good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product ,  definitely worth a watch . 
1	since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english ,  i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing ( 2000 )  as presented in the bandai released dvd set .  my actual review for the whole series is under imdb's entry of  "  " shin kid√¥ senki gundam w "  ( 1995 )  .   very little is changed in respect to plot ,  script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in .  purists can stick to japanese all they want ,  but for a more  " realistic "  experience i recommend the english track since all the characters ,  except heero yuy ,  are not japanese .  ( most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non-japanese asians .  )  for one thing ,  the characters' personalities come across more  " directly "  than in the japanese version .  the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give-or-take performances but a very well cast group of actors .   wing gundam's pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity .  voiced by mark hildreth who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as  " bad acting "  but it matches heero's personality very well .   deathscythe gundam's duo maxwell ,  ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends .  he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show ,  masterfully played by scott mcneil .  he may sound a little too old for his age ,  but duo's english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one .   trowa ,  the pilot of heavyarms ,  is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat ;  despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him ,  he only knows how to kill ,  not to befriend .  kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton .   quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand .  a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl ( and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version )  but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy .   the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over-the-top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa .   relena darlian sounds older in english ,  voiced by lisa ann bailey .  this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story ,  her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development .   zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version .  both voices bring out different sides to the same character .  his japanese voice is haughty ,  authoritative and commands respect  ,  keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature .  his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued ,  sounding more devious and  " snake-like "  ,  highlighting zechs' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals .   the members of oz are a mixed bag really .  treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his larger-than-life japanese style of speaking .  however ,  lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . bored most of the time .  the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either .   i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds .  the maganac corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents .  the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility .   despite underwhelming acting from the side characters ,  the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over-the-top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing's script .  very faithful to the original japanese script ,  keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics ,  war and human nature .  sadly ,  it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script . 
0	oh dear .  .  .  as an englishman ,  and a small part welsh ,  a fan of anthony hopkins' work in the industry .  .  .  .  .  to date ,  i am truly disappointed .    you see i am a nobody ,  who hoped for better .  so my comments are as 'straw in the wind' .  but ,  that's the point isn't it ?  - i have no axe to grind on the commercial value of a work .  i ,  a full member of the great unwashed ,  go to see a movie to be transported to another place .  to yes ,  suspend belief for a brief period .  but not to enter a state of total disbelief .   had this been by an unknown author and director ,  i would guess that this 'production' would have been castigated into oblivion .  unfortunately ,  its not ,  and i was left wide eyed and confused .  having seen some of the rave reviews given this work i am faintly worried .  .  .  .   perhaps its that i try ,  without prejudice ,  to view each movie on its own merits .  regardless of author ,  director ,  studio or even the notoriety of the content .   my advice ,  as many before me :  don't write and direct the same production .  it is fraught with danger .  movies need to be moderated to retain a semblance of credibility .   as they say in school reports  " could and can do better .  .  .  " 
1	following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use .  the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah's erratic persona which ,  beyond general insensitivity ,  has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on ,  making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene .  sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed .  every time she speaks it's like a self-contained 5 second skit .  she overemotes a lot ,  demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify ,  but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied .  this may be the most creative ,  original and experimental tv program ever .
