1	have n't had for long but it seems to be a nice deal for the money . it does a lot of exercises . and seems easy to convert between types
1	first off , let me start by saying that i really like my summit watch . it is large ( some may go so far to call it huge ) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist , and quite comfortable to wear . those with bad eyesight will still be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time , barometric pressure , altitude and compass . the numbers are quite big , so they are difficult to miss . the altitude reading measures in increments of +/- 1 foot , which is about as good as you can get . i like that . but what i really like about the highgear watches that i have n't seen in other brands which offer similar features , is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be . no kidding , this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny , partly cloudy , or raining . pretty dang nifty if you ask me . the barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather , however after months of use , i have to say that my little watch is way more accurate than my local tv weatherman . i 'd say somewhere around 75 % of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually are . not bad . it 's a feature i would very much like to have on my suunto and casio models with similar functions . until then , i 'll rely on my trusty ( and much cheaper ) highgear summit . if you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass , altitude and barometer functions , before making that specific buy , do some homework and wherever possible , seek out a store where you can actually see the watches in person . being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase . find the best price , and pull the model out and actually try it on before you buy . for me , the highgear summit was a good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package , try the highgear axis , or possibly the more stylish but much more compact ( and way more expensive ) suunto observer . either way , doing a little homework will pay off in the end . happy hiking and i hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product . good luck

1	i had gotten my wife a new bike and needed to find a helmet for her above-average sized cranium . the bell triton was it . it fit perfectly the first time she put it on and adjusted it . i would recommend it for anyone with a good-sized head on their shoulders
