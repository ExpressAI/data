1	imagine making a beehive cake or a honey-citrus iced tea . when looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors . you will be cutting out a lot of recipes ! in fact , i 'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing . there are 16 pages of recipes in a `` card '' format . the favorite meal section and cooking for one or two is always of interest . it shows you how to put an entire meal together and all the recipes are included . there is also a section where you can view enviable country kitchens . then you can learn how to make ordinary foods extraordinary . add curry powder to chicken salad or add brewed coffee to cookie dough . the `` men who run the range '' section is a series featuring men who love to cook and then you can also find out what people are eating in various states across the country . these are ideas and recipes from real cooks across america . one time i looked in the `` does anyone have ... ? '' section and found a note about a woman who was looking for specific items . after sending her a small box , she then reciprocated and sent me the most beautiful framed pressed flowers . it is a fun section where you can read about recipes people are looking for and if you have the recipe , there is an address where you can mail the item . i recently learned how to make rosemary crackers and someone is looking for a recipe for various crackers . this magazine also has info on cooking schools all over the country . you could also be a field editor and share your recipes , cooking tips and other ideas with the home-office staff . you could literally end up in this magazine ! some of the delicious recipes i 've been clipping from this magazine include : grilled sirloin steak crispy fried chicken herbed seafood skewers chicken with rosemary vegetable cheese tortellini grilled turkey burgers beehive cake honey citrus iced tea tonight i made a chicken dish with homemade stuffing and a mushroom gravy that my husband really loved . i think this magazine inspires me to cook more and i have never read this magazine without tearing out pages galore . now i 'm dreaming about the pear crisp with lemon sauce and the raspberry cheesecake pie . ~therebeccareview.com
1	there are a few magazines about writing serious writers need to read . `` poets writers '' is one of them . it has a literary bent , but avoids the nose-in-the-air attitude . it is practical and educational , and is pleasingly presented . a favorite factor for me are the long feature articles on the culture of writing . in the issue out now , there are two major articles . one is about author stuart dybek and his fiction that pulls from his experience growing up on chicago 's colorful south side . the other is about writing contests , dealing with how ethical they are run , the view of literary judges , and when a writer should considering entering one . the secondary articles are as informative and as useful , whether you want to learn about promoting your book , doing online workshops or understand the trends driving the industry . contests , incidentally , are a big part of pw 's value . the magazine tells you who won , and which contests/grants are currently accepting submissions . pw is careful to screen which contests are listed , ensuring only legitimate ones make it through the editors . the writing itself is interesting . it is not always true that writing magazines are fun to read . it should be , and in the case of pw , everything is engaging . pw 's design is clean . it looks like what a small press literary magazine should look like . the typography and layout are not pretentious or overbearing , but get the job done . it is never work to read this magazine . i fully recommend `` poets writers . '' you will be better informed about writing and writers , just like the titles implies . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co
1	although i have yet to subscribe to aperture , what i 've heard and what little i 've seen advertised in one of sally mann 's famous publications is enough to arouse my interest , and i ca n't wait to partake of a first issue of 'aperture ' . feedback from other members is always anticipated and welcomed
1	i absolutely love this magazine ! it is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong . i will be 38 in a few weeks , and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine . i read it from beginning to end , and my husband even reads it . he always asks if i saw the article on this or that , which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging . if you are serious about your health , want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level , this is the magazine for you
