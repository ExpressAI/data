1	this movie is full of memorable scenes , although it 's probably been more than a decade since i last saw it . it 's suspenseful without being gory ... the most memorable scene is one that is absolutely chilling without ever showing a drop of blood . and even though i 'd read the book and knew the outcome i was on the edge of my seat right to the finish
1	this dvd contains three episodes of `` bear in the big blue house . '' the first two have a birthday party theme . the final one does n't really anything to do with a party , but it is still rocking . the fun starts with `` mouse party '' when our friends in the big blue house put together a surprise party for tutter the mouse . the viewer is asked to keep the secret as they prepare the party - putting together the decorations , making the cake and keeping tutter in the dark . tutter considers the fact that he 's getting older and finally , viewers rock to `` happy , happy birthday '' when the time comes for tutter 's big party . next comes `` bear 's birthday bash . '' this is an episode that recalls `` mouse party '' in many ways , except this time it 's bear who 's having the birthday . he 'd like to have a nice , relaxing day , but the kids of the big blue house decide to throw him a surprise party . finally , `` dancin ' the day away '' finds everyone in the big blue house having some fun with dance . tutter , however , does n't think that he can dance , but pip and pop show him that he really can . this is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable characters and stories . my favorites are tutter and ojo ( and the big old bear himself ) , but they 're all wonderful . this dvd includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs
1	i 'm not sure if anyone has pointed this out but the voice 's for paul and company is not their own , these were in fact voice actors and they did a very good job too . this was also confirmed by paul proir to the movies release
1	it seems to me there 's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era . i 'm not arguing it 's either better or worse than others , it just feels different and very distinctive . in this light , `` wall street '' reminded me vividly of `` no way out '' for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several de palma films . do n't ask me why . it just does . useless considerations apart , `` wall street '' , directed by always controversial oliver stone , pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away . they always burn out , in a snap of fingers . and bigger they are , harder they fall , right ? the story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen , featuring a bright young `` sport '' , bud fox ( played by charlie sheen ) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life . he wants more , and hotshot gordon gekko ( michael douglas ) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful , vicious , influential and a sure winner . by sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence , bud sneaks into gekko 's office and tries to prove his value to him . from here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young proteg√© who rises to the top at breakneck speed until , unexpectedly , something shatters his bond to the master . something that hits home and makes bud question his beliefs . what this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie , so i 'll let that for you to find out if you did n't see it yet . all the acting is quite superb , especially the relationship between gekko and fox . martin sheen - who is charlie sheen 's father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work , not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down . he reminds me of donald sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he 's on screen a couple of minutes at a time . if you like high finance intrigue , big guys pulling the strings on each other , twists and turns , then `` wall street '' is probably essential . and it will probably give you an excuse to read sun tzu 's `` the art of war ''
0	all `` style '' and no substance . even the dance number with john travolta uma thurman was lackluster . and would cedric the `` entertainer '' please go away ? i 've never seen anything with him in it that was any good . i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud . i think christina milian 's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over .
