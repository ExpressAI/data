1	very nice , warm blanket , but too big for a full size bed , way too big
1	the glasses are nice quality , but like the majority of other people who ordered these they arrived broken because of insufficient packing material . you would think someone at amazon would fix the problem instead of shipping these over and over again
0	my wife bought this one from best buy without me reviewing it 1st . amazingly , i would have bought it after reading the reviews here . i 'm starting to wonder who writes these things ... lg employees ? the microwave is fine - no complaints . the toaster , however , is an unmitigated disaster . i am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances - this appliance is a poster child for this thought . the toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently ( sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5 and sometimes as high as 10 ! ) . more importantly , the toaster broke after 31 days ( coincidently the best buy return policy ends at the same time - best buy has an unacceptable return policy but with a guy named `` ricky '' managing the store what can you expect ? ) . lg picks up the phone quickly and they honor the warranty . the problem is they ca n't think outside of the box . they had me get it repaired but i have to inconveniently drive it out there and pick it up - ok ... no problem . one day later ? it breaks again . it is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought they had fixed it and had not . that 's how bad it was . lg will not budge - have it repaired again ( great option - costs lg money , me more travel time , and it wo n't do the job ) or do a rebate . the rebate requires me to buy another lg or goldstar product . huh ? so you create a shoddy product and rush it to the marketplace ( they admitted they do n't have a detailed enough repair history because it is too new ) and then do n't stand behind your product . you backend me into another lg or goldstar product that i would not have otherwise bought . how does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here ? our we so bad as a manufacturer that we ca n't top this ? their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no getting around this . `` you can cal korea but they wo n't change their policy '' they said . i will never willingly buy another lg or goldstar product and i highly recommend you do the same . shame on you lg - you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years and now your name is mud to me
1	the stool fits under my kitchen table and is easy to move around . i bought this stool for my 3 year old grandson , he pulls it up to the sink when he wants to get a drink of water and he sits on it when he eats his lunch . he loved mine so i bought him one of his own
1	the plastic top has no vents thereby producing rubbery , boiled tasting popcorn . easily solved ! i drilled about a dozen 1/8 inch holes in the top ( bottom ? ) of the plastic bowl and voila ! wonderful , crispy , crunchy popcorn .
