1	i subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to woodworkers journal since 1990 . each magazine has a character of it 's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents . this magazine is a bit more complex than , say wood magazine . it should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified . i have one of woodworking journal 's projects in my living room . it is perhaps the most beautiful piece i have ever made . if you have become an advanced amature ( sp ? ) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others
0	i ordered this magazine thru amazon three months ago , and still have n't received a single issue . i 've emailed their subscription department to no avail . they have my money , but i do n't have a magazine
0	so i 'm mostly with other folks on the content . if you get lucky , the small sampling of product reviews will include some item you 're looking at ( or should ) , and the anemic review will prompt you to follow up at the manufacturers website . the `` buyer 's guide '' was of decent breadth and useless depth on the bikes . no bikes from gary fisher , the inventor of mountain biking . huh ? i 'm primarily interested in mtb and the issues of mountain bike are good . but , you only get 4 issues , and the content is redundant between the two magazines ( or even within each mag ) . for instance , the may mtb issue had a story on rebuilding trails in los alamos ( i actually really like their reviews of specific places ) , and the cover also boasted a `` great american trail guide . '' one of the four trails talked about in this `` great american..guide '' : los alamos . i can spot a cut and paste job when i see one . also in that issue `` the bike that started a revolution '' about the sp stumpjumper . a great idea for an interesting article that was butchered into a condescending comic strip . also , having ordered the mag for the issues of mtb , i was disappointed when they did n't even show up . emails with customer service resulted in one of the more disappointing `` did you not read my email '' type exchanges . two months later , and i now have one of the two missing issues in hand . they have great photography , and i have yet to find a better option , but i 'm really disappointed . i wo n't renew
1	i have been a long time subscriber to vogue knitting , it was one of the few us knitting magazines that had really fashionable knitting patterns . i am from germany , where there are lots of knitting magazines with really chic patterns , i missed that when i moved to the us . however , i find that the content in vogue knitting really fluctuated - sometimes it was packed with great designs , sometimes , it was just too far out and there was n't a single pattern i wanted to knit . i stopped my subscription for a while . then the editor changed and now the magazine is somewhere in the middle - not too funky , yet still chic and fun . i still enjoy reading it every once in a while . after having my daughter , i changed my subscription to family circle easy knitting , since vogue knitting does not carry any patterns for babies or kids , which i really find a shame . i even wrote a letter to the editor saying that this was a major omission . especially because it is very hard to find chic and elegant kids knits in magazines - not those acrylic yarn patterns with bears on them ! the german magazines do a great job of having some unique , but still fun kids designs . if you want a very trendy knitting magazine that uses a whole range of yarns ( some very expensive ) , then vogue knitting is the magazine for you . if you are looking for elegant knits that are more functional , but still challenging , i would suggest interweave knits and rebecca ( english version of a german magazine ) , both carry some really interesting and challenging patterns . if you have kids , there is n't much out there , i would suggest family circle easy knitting , also rebecca does a kids issue once a year , which should not be missed
1	this is not the kind of magazine you read , at least not cover to cover . this is for serious shopping , or shopping ideas . feel a whole in your wardrobe ? lucky can tell you what to put in it for a variety of price ranges . that is one of the reasons i really like this magazine it shows different price ranges of a style so you can decide how much you want to spend on the perfect look . it also gives great website types , which is very helpful when your stuck out in the middle of the continent . the `` everyday girl '' advice on mixing and maxing is often lacking , but the magazine makes up for it with pages of clothing , shoes , etc . devoted to shopping , pick this up
