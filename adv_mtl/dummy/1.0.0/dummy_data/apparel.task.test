1	the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got , after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80 's purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge . i was blown away
0	this light worked for one day . i should have known better because in the past , i bought a tap light , and it worked for only a few days , too . do n't waste your money
1	i 've tried 6 different nursing bras . this one , with the center snap closure , is the easiest to use . it is also the lightest and most comfortable , while providing good support . my only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric . even when i try to sew it back into place , it breaks loose after a few washes . perhaps if i handwashed the bra instead of using a machine , it would last longer . this bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras ( particularly the leading lady bra , which seems to be indestructible ) , but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort , lightness , and ease of use . it is by far my favorite
0	i have had my bag for a couple of months . the liner on the inside has already ripped
0	the photo is quite deceiving . this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap , shiny , and is horrible to the touch . my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness . spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit
