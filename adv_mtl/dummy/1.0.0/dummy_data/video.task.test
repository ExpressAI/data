1	this is a good entry in the mr. moto canon , which comprises 8 films made between 1937-39 . it is not my favorite , however -- mr. moto takes a vacation , with excellent performances by lionel atwill and joseph schildkraut , is the best of those i 've seen . however , they have been very hard to find , and i 've only seen about half of them . lorre is wonderful as the mysterious mr. moto , and the films are great fun and skilfully made , with a host of terrific character actors -- in addition to atwill and schildkraut , leon ames , jean hersholt , keye luke , john carradine , george sanders , virginia field , ricardo cortez , maxie rosenbloom , and many others all turn in outstanding period performances . it is a real shame that more are not being made available -- i know that art houses sometimes stage special showings , and i keep hoping that someone will release all eight on dvd . please
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec. well , they charged me for it , and i did n't really want it . i just thought i 'd try it because it was free . there is no verification before you are charged either . it is supposed to be free , you hit a button , and boom , there is a charge on your credit card . never again ! ! ! ..and the directions do n't work , so i do n't even have the `` free '' stuff i paid for
0	this film stinks . it gives b scifi a bad name -- even makes those roger corman movies look stunning . if possible , i would give it a negative rating to balance the positive reviews seen here . if you want cornball underwater action , buy `` voyage to the bottom of the sea . '' provided that your cerebral cortex is active , you 'll agree it 's a zillion times better
1	i had viewed this movie on tv a while ago . i am a hospice nurse and found this movie so down to earth and informative about what a person 's thoughts might be in the face of a debilitating condition . most of the nurses that i work with have gained new insight . lest i lead you astray this is not a documentary for medical personnel . it is a wonderful protrayal of one woman 's battle
1	i finally made my first purchase from amazon 's unbox video downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience . for $ 1.99 , i purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of `` the twilight zone '' , and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection . i do n't think it 's the most ideal way to see full-length motion pictures , but for a 26-minute classic tv program , i think my 17 '' lcd monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience , and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean . aired on september 15 , 1961 as the show 's third season opener , the episode is a cold war fantasy appropriately called `` two '' about the last two survivors on earth , a man and a woman , after an apocalyptic world war in 2109 . written and directed by tv veteran montgomery pittman , the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an american infantryman and she is an invading russian soldier . like two feral animals , they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war . he even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him . the reality of their solitary existence , however , gradually dawns on them , especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue - `` prekrassnyi '' - the russian word for `` lovely '' . what really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting . two years before she twitched her nose on `` bewitched '' , a brunette elizabeth montgomery , looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun , plays the untrusting russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability . the american is played by perennial tough-guy charles bronson , fresh from `` the magnificent seven '' . even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war , he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism . they make an odd couple , but it works splendidly . i also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the 22nd century . narrated by rod serling in his inimitably halting manner , the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript : `` this has been ... a love story . '' this is classic tv
