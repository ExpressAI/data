1	i purchased the 2gb elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp sp2 with and without the most recent simpletech drivers . i do n't have another card reader for my computer , but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader . shortly afterwards , i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 sd/mmc reader for a bit less in price than the card alone . i also noticed the atp line of 60x and 150x sd cards . i have no experience with their products , but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell . they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof . i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me , but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors , i will consider the atp cards in the future .
0	the alarms do n't pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications . they repeat twice and then quit . the light does n't flash except the first time . half of the time they do n't work . i sent it back for repair and they did n't do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day . same problem , it is the way it is designed but they wo n't admit it

1	i purchased this remote to replace a broken tv/dvd/vcr combo remote . before buying it i checked specs of several brands and types to see if they could be programmed for my combo . this was the only one that definitely could . it has worked well ... a couple features are not available but i expect that with any replacement control . i 've also programmed it to my bose radio and my dish network box and the controls have worked just fine . now my coffee table is a lot less cluttered
