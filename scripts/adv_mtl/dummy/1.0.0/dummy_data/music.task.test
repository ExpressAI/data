1	if you liked the original clerks soundtrack , then you 're sure to love this . thirteen years after we heard randall and dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first clerks soundtrack , now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is , in fact , the real trilogy . and we , the clerks fans , get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track . oh , and did i mention the music ? terrific ! kevin smith 's choices are so fitting for each scene in the movie . it 's not too difficult to imagine that kevin has been thinking about these track choices for a long time . in typical kevin smith fashion , the usual array of artists are included as well as some cool surprises . you 've got your typical soul asylum and alanis morrisette as well as king diamond and an unexpected jackson 5 dance number . if you have not seen the movie , please make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack . doing so is sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to them . overall , a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure to please any clerks fan .
0	i deeply love the music of joni mitchell . it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you , to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it ( as i stupidly did ) . the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it ( a new mature joni ! a return to the roots ! a brilliant acoustic album ! and nonsense like these ... ) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see ( well , hear ) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years ( except `` dog eat dog '' which is superb , but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it 's an '80s disaster ) . it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening . ok , some lyrics are quite good , but nothing compares to the joni of the '60s and '70s . so , i really do not get the point : it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say ( how painful it is to face reality ! ) , so , why should all of you praise her ? just because of what she did in the past ? ok , let us say that she was the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation ( according to me , much better than bob dylan ) and let us praise her forever because of that ; but i truly can not accept that we still flatter her in everything she does , even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art . i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album ( and anything else from 1982 up to now - except , as i said , `` dog eat dog '' ) . if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell , try anything you want from the 60s and 70s . really , anything . try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins . you have to be prepared , for it could be beautifully dangerous : once you know her , you will never let her go away from your soul
0	i was so disappointed with this cd . at least 6 of the songs were recorded from very old albums ... .scratches and all ! they were so bad . i play two of the songs over and over ... the only two i liked . when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs , i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song ... .i was wrong . i do n't know why they had to add the scratchy music..a filler ? i would quickly skip to another song ... only to have to `` skip '' many times !
1	five stars may be excessive if you judge this cd alongside the greatest classics , but when compared to similar cds within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre , this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines . i find myself coming back to this cd more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest . the writing , while occasionally a bit awkward , is consistently interesting , honest and moving . the themes of introspection , nostalgia , regret , and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner . the song `` if i were a man '' is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world ; `` child of steel '' plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy ; and `` take my body '' is a strong lament about the objectification of women . i especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements ; the simplicity really works with ms. cash 's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments . i 've seen ms. cash perform live and , while she has other hits that may be more popular , this collection reveals her unique brilliance
0	it is beyond me that a record label would put this out . it 's so embarassing how bad he rips bright eyes from song structure , subject the production and even the cover art looks just like fevers and mirrors .
