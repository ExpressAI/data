1	my 3 3/4 yr old got these for christmas and he loves them . plays with them almost every day . we bought both dinosaur kits and they are fun to combine together . my son loves to not only put together the `` proper '' dinosaurs , but make up his own creatures as well . a fun way for dinosaur loving kids to engage in some creative `` think outside the box '' play
1	i have wanted to buy a musini for my son for a few years now , but never found one in a retail store , online or local . i recently gave in and bought one gently used on ebay for a fantastic price including the cartridge . my entire family loves it , including my 2-year-old son . it was very easy to figure out how to use , even without a manual . on the battery case are very clear , easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate the sensitivity of your musini . within minutes we had found the perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all dancing . even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping to the musini ! my dad could n't keep his feet still , insisting on drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute . i have found myself taking it out during my son 's nap time to put near me while i do the mundane chores around the house . it is really addicting and keeps us all moving ! i ca n't say enough good things about this toy . the music quality is absolutely wonderful and is clear and crisp and a joy to listen to . you also tend to feel like you are actually playing an instrument when you 're dancing around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers . the songs are mostly familiar and well-loved songs that you will instantly recognize . i have also noticed that you can use the musini to up your child 's physical activity . if you change the sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard , you suddenly have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of exercise ! you can , of course , adjust the sensitivity so that a single finger tap across the room will register . it 's up to you , and i think it 's fantastic ! highly recommended
1	my daughter rec 'd this game as a gift for her fourth birthday . it was wonderful because my son , who was two could play it too ( with my assistance of course ) . now they are 5 and 7 and still play it . it is a simple game that requires no reading skills and reinforces counting . i would recommend it to everyone
0	fisher price is selling the same item for only $ 33 . $ 139.99 has to be a mistake
0	our family bought this tank and we went through plenty of goldfish with it . we stopped buying when our 10 year old was using the scope to look at the fish . she was pulling it up and down and turning it and when she was finished , she put it down and saw that she had put it down on the actual fish . the fish was bleeding and died . the kids were not very happy . i guess this is an okay tank but not great . you might want to put only beta 's in it . i would suggest getting something with a filter and heater if you want any other kind of fish
