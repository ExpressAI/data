0	i 'm an amateur photographer and i use photoshop cs2 for most of my digital editing . i decided i needed a colorimeter based on the recommendations of many books that i have read on digital editing . i had to download an update of the software program before i could start using my spyder . this procedure alone took several hours because i kept getting `` error '' messages . i ca n't count how many times i unloaded and reloaded the program . i was eventually able to run the program , however , every time i calibrated my one year old emachine crt monitor , it left me with an orange color cast on my screen . i worked with colorvision technical support for many frustrating hours . the technical support person i was working with was very pleasant and really tried to help me . they even mailed me a new sensor because they thought the first one was defective . unfortunately i was unable to get the orange color cast removed from my monitor . after several weeks of trying to get the spyder2 express to calibrate my monitor , i gave up . i just did n't want to spend any more time trying to get it to work so it was returned . i really wanted it to work . i 'm back to using adobe gamma .
1	i 'm 9 years old and play this game frequently . i love to play it . it 's not frustrating at all and it 's totally exciting with many adorable animals . i did n't like her wardrobe in the beginning but then i bought a dresser and changed her outfit . the pigs are fun to treat ! ! ! ! ! they 're smart ! ! the rabbits are soft and adorable ; having my favorite animal being rabbits . i play this game for at least a half an hour a day and ca n't wait for the next time playing it ! ! ! ! get this game and try it out ! ! it 's the best !
1	i am enjoying the talk now ! learn bulgarian cd . great images , repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words , numbers , time , etc . easy . also , the games add interest . you can print out each section with photos and words in bulgarian . however , i would have liked to see the program come with the cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide .
1	i 'm currently learning how to use this product ; however , one of the first things i noticed was that the only way to do my payroll with it was to use a service . now of course , this service was n't free and with only 4 employees , the last thing i wanted to do was expend $ 20 a month on a service . was n't that the point of getting quickbooks - so i could do it myself ? now i can understand that tax codes , percentages , etc can vary from state to state , but would it have been so difficult for them to just set up a section with the generalized accounts and have the user input the amounts for each account needed on their payroll checks . see , i 'm not even asking them to have the computer calculate the amounts . simple would have been fine with me . as for the rest of the program , it looks as though it will be fairly easy to use after i figure out the best way to set it up for my particular business . i 'm disappointed that a business program designed for the small businessman would omit something as vital as payroll
1	cd installs easily , it even comes with a nice short instructional video . once installed , zoneaalarm is fairly unobtrusive , but seems to get the job done . well-designed product
