1	i have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best . the thickness ( 1/8 inch ) is just perfect - not too thick so it 's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning . what i really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip , in a word , it is comfortable .
0	after 2 attempts at having this shipped to me , and both times having it arrive broken . i have given up this model . it 's a shame that the poor packaging on the machine is the reason for the rowers rating . if you can buy one at the store , it may be a great unit , but do n't let it go ups
1	this gun was great . when i got it i immediatly pulled it out and went to play with it . good for kids just starting out with bb guns . also it is n't that powerful . overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is $ 0.0
1	it had special meaning for me , because when my two daughters were little ( they are now in their late 30s ) , i taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they did n't flush . i caught them both with the toilet monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences . it is more funny than scary , though it does give you a start when you first open the lid
1	by wife and i bought both the men and womens model . they were a great buy , arrived on time and were easy to assemble . they 're comfortable to ride and seem to be well built . enjoy .
