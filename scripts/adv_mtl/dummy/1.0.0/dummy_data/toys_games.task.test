1	my 2 year old loves it ... though one set of grandparents ca n't stand the noise so if you do n't like noisy toys - obviously this is n't one for you . otherwise its great ! runs out of battery very quickly though .
0	like many others , the arm on my 4 year olds excavator broke as well who can we contact for help ? there is no information on the box
0	if you want a beautiful asian doll , i just found a couple in ebay under `` asian berenguer girl doll `` . the one i got on ebay was gorgerous ! ! ! my daughter loves it and wo n't leave home without it .
1	everyone in the children 's room at the avon library loves the gazillion bubble machine . it is used frequently during story hours and captures all the chidren 's attention . it 's not necessarily educational but is alot of fun
0	we got this for our son for easter , and he was playing with donnie the dumptruck , and the handle part was opened , so it was the flat blue portion of the truck , well he some how slipped , and ended up cutting his forehead b/c the blue portion does have somewhat of a sharp part . luckily enough it was n't where he needed stitches , but still ... so i called little tikes , and they said they wanted me to mail it back and they let me choose another toy-so there customer service at little tikes is definitly a + ! just watch out because i think the ages on this toy should be a little older . semper f
