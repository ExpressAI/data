0	the pick-up artist is a dangerously bad film . there is absolutely no chemistry between robert downey and molly ringwald . molly ringwald may have been of the most iconic 1980 's female actresses , and she certainly proves her worth here . ringwald looks too much of a virgin to me when her character was n't supposed to be . that marks the moment when the film had lost its believably element . the real joke in this film has to be robert downey . his acting is insanely moronic . i often have to wonder if he wears a lipstick . i am pretty sure robert downey can make a great drag queen if he chose to . from the start to the end , i was annoyed . i could n't see how dennis hopper and danny aiello got interested in this film and lend their hands in it . harvey keitel gives a fair performance , but i believe he is much tougher than that . comparing harvey keitel 's performance in bad lieutenant , reservoir dogs , and mean streets to the pick-up artist , it is enough to make an apparent observation that harvey keitel should have applied his talents to a more different film than this . a smaller film that he did rightfully apply his talent was rising sun , and he pulled that one off better than he did in this film . why did they have to call it the pick-up artist ? could they give the movie a better title such as the player
1	if you have read and enjoyed the book then you will love the movie . micky rourke is excellent ( this is still in the days when he could act ) and so is the rest of this stellar cast . well worth it
1	first of all , let me say kudos to the seller for getting this to me as quickly as they did . it took about three business days from the time i placed the order . anyway , i love a good ghost story . ghosts are still to me , the quickest and easiest way to illicit fear . think back to when you were a kid and could stay up all night watching dracula or a stalker movie but had a chill running down your spine when you simply heard a good ghost story . but they have to have to have to be done right . in real estate the three rules are location location location , in ghost movies it 's atmospherte atmosphere atmosphere . the tricks of the trade are all old , but just like tripping on a banana peel , if done right , it works . the devils backbone not only gets it right , it bravely decides to take it deeper . calling this movie a ghost story period is a huge disservice . yes there are sections where there is a ghost present , but the ghost itself quickly fades into the background while we are pulled into a story that revolves around a time and an event that no american from my generation could completly grasp ... and that heightens the movie from a simple chilling tale into something far more relevant . the plot of the movie revolves around carlos , a young spansih boy dropped off unsuspectingly at a boys school during the spanish civil war after his father has been killed ( which for the length of the movie he never is told ) . he befriends one of the older caretakers , a few of the boys , and butts heads with a former student who now lives on the premesis . also he is informed by the students that someone else is on these grounds too , they call him `` the one who sighs '' . he appears to carlos a few times in shadow and in one particularly suspensful scene , in full body trying to tell him something , but for most of the movie , carlos simpy does what anyone else would do ... he runs . its only when he stops and listens does he learn to stand on his own two feet and to do what must be done to become not only a man before his time , but to save the lives of the other children he 's boarding with . it would be ignorant of me to suppose i can deduce everything the director ( guillermo del toro ) is trying to say , especially without knowing jack about spains history ( i had to look it up to find out what conflict was the central backdrop ) . what i took away from the movie is this-to become a man , you have to be willing to risk everything for whats right . its also a nicely told revenge story as the true main villain of the movie comes clear and states very clearly and elegantly what lot of movies clumsily stumble over themselves trying to . that alot of times fear of the unknown is nothing compared to what evil lurks in us and what we are capable of doing to one another . this is all very surface and obvious i know , and im sure symbolically it has alot more going on , but thats what repeat viewings are for . mr del tormo directs with a kids love for spook settings and a man who desparatly loves his countries sensitive eye . no other recent '' ghost story '' that i can think of has such an accomplished visual flare while blending 3-dimensional characters into a tapestry capturing a time and place so vividly . it also has to be said that the main cast , most of whom are children ranging from 10-15 do a very good job and he must have a gift for bringing a credible performance out of them , like spielberg or shyamalan . bottom line , the ghost sections of the movie really work , but what makes the movie is the human element . the ghost story becomes secondary and that 's not a complaint , anything else would have been a disservice to a heart renching story . mr del
