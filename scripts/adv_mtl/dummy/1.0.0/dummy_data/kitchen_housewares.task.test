0	this is the worst pan i have ever had . we love mini muffins and have had wilton and other pans . they are hard to clean so i thought i would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap . 1st . the silicone smell was horrible . 2nd . the pan warped in oven . i used the sled it came with and followed directions 3rd . i washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue 4th . the muffins did not come out . i used spray i waited until cool and still they stuck . i will never buy silicone anything . do n't waiste your money
0	i bought this about two years ago and it never worked very good for me . the handle does n't stay together very good and it does n't pick up much . i would n't recommend this sweeper to anyone . do n't waste your money on it
1	cast iron pans are the way to go . no dangerous non-stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them . this one is probably the best i have ever owned . only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner . bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges . but for pancakes , etc . this is perfect . get this one and a smaller 10 '' pan and you 'll have bases covered .
1	my boxers just love the little balls . they like digging them out of the container even though it did not take very long after they got the hang of it . they carry the balls and container all over the house and yard . it has held up very well . we have had this over a year now , and i only had to stich up maybe 2 of the balls once each . squeekers still work great - have n't needed to replace yet . very happy with this toy
0	the windtunnel ii is a poorly constructed vacuum . it is less than six months old and the motor for the hepa filter had to be replaced . it is very messy when you have to empty the tank . dust and dirt collect around the hepa filter and falls down when you are emptying the tank .
