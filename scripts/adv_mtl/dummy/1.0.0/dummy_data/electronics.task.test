0	the leather case works great . easy access to buttons , space for business cards and sd cards . ah ! ... the smell ... leather . five stars
0	this thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over . we thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery did n't help . do n't buy this item . i am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here
0	i 've come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse . the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface , and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser wo n't track right . i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it did n't test it well enough . unless your willing to do that skip this one , it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice . i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul . but then again you do get what you pay for :
1	i needed extra space for pictures and musis downloads this was just right not too expensive and large enought to fit the purpose
0	these actually left my screen dirtier than i started with . it left behind annoying streaks and film which i ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution . i suggest keeping a soft cloth with some 1:1 water and rubbing alcohol handy ; it 's cheaper and more effective
