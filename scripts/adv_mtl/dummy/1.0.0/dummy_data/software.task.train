1	i highly recommend microsoft digitial image suite 10 and the free gimp programs for all of your digital imaging needs ! ! ! ( ... ) dis 10 should be out now..
0	i 've been using a mac for the last 10+ years and i had assumed that windows had gotten better since win 94 . boy was i wrong . it amazes me that the entire world runs on this awful excuse for an os .
1	i teach presentation skills , so i 'm always on the lookout for things that make powerpoint better . i 've tried and recommended other software in the past , but none of them have the power of ovation . this is an outstanding piece of software . the visual effects are stunning , and it 's so easy to use that a child could learn it in a few minutes . powerpoint is boring , and everyone 's presentations look the same . not any more ! full-motion backgrounds and effects really jazz up your presentations , and they have over 100 professional-looking business themes available . see their website ( seriousmagic dot com ) for a demonstration of what it can do . all you have to do is drag and drop your powerpoint presentation on the ovation icon , choose a theme and the effects , and voila ! - a new presentation ! the current version 1.0 can not process embedded video or audio files , but they say that will be fixed with the first patch within the next month or two . despite that shortcoming , this is the best powerpoint enhancement available - heads and shoulders above the competitors
0	i was looking for an intructional cd to help my daughter to learn chess . i read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what i was looking for . wrong ! first of all , the cd comes with no instruction book and you 're left to try and figure out what you 're supposed to do by yourself ( good luck ) . i 've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and i still have n't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess . i 've emailed their 'help line ' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them . save your money and your sanity and do n't buy this cd .
0	they sent me a product that was n't legit and would n't take it back . horrible service i do n't recommend anyone buy from this particular vendor ! just a horrible waste of time money
