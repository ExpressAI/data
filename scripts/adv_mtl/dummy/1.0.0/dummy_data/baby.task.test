0	it 's flimsy ... breaks at the slightest touch ... it 's a pain to open and close ! my 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens ... i found this out when i was putting groceries away ... i went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top ! i ca n't say enough bad things about this gate . it 's worthless . if i could rate it minus stars i would
0	my almost- 3 yr old daughter needed a new umbrella stroller ( she 's tall , but still gets tired sometimes , especially if i take her shopping ) . i researched the options and picked the maclaren volo . my first stroller before it was chicco capri , and it always bumped against my legs , which was annoying and uncomfortable . when the canopy broke , i got rid of it and decided on buying a new one for plane travel and local outings . the volo seemed great - light , handsome , convenient , and highly rated by parents . i ordered the stroller and , upon unpacking it , was quite pleased with its appearance . i read the instructions and learned to use it . the stroller seemed sturdy , well-made , and easy to maneuver , not to mention chic . the washable seat was a good idea , i thought . i liked how large it was ( perfect for an older child ) , and how easily it moved . when i took the new volo around the block , i noticed that one of the double back wheels was not aligned properly ( one was higher than the other and did not rotate , which caused the stroller to make a scraping sound ) . then the other set stopped rotating when one ( ! ) pine needle got stuck in it ! i had to carefully remove it with my hands in the middle of the street . needless to say , that 's not the quality i expected , since every parent i know raved about maclaren . the canopy kept sliding off the rails , as well - something you would not want at the airport , with your toddler and luggage and the car seat in tow . when i got home , i looked at the wheels closely and tried to adjust them , but to no avail . they were flimsy ( i could dent them with my finger if i wanted to ! ) , way too small and just poorly designed . i immediately packed up the stroller and returned it to amazon . i was very disappointed . one would think that for such a high price , the wheels would be usable - after all , they are the most important feature of any stroller . i will stay with chicco and order a c6 . at least i know that the wheels are great , and you ca n't beat the price
0	i have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it did not work . the bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt/buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed . my friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better
0	my wife purchased this toy box at our local toys r us . it went together fine , but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like wet paint . in fact , we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room . little tykes makes this unit , but they were of no help when i called customer satisfaction . they told me just to return it and that they 've never heard of this problem .
0	i bought this carseat ( different color ) because i liked the features . however , everytime i put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward . i have tried everything , from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks , to trying to push the base down so it does n't sit up so high . do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn 's head ploped forward so bad that he is choking . not good graco , this carseat could not have been tested before . i had an evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem . i am truly disappointed . can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away , i am all ears . i know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue . i have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem . help ! ! !
