1	item is exactly as pictured/described . cute design and good quality . adds a nice touch . highly recommend
1	this little seat is very secure - no slipping or moving around on the toilet , yet it is easy to take on and off . it also sits tight enough that nothing leaks between the trainer seat and the toilet seat . very easy to clean as well . i will warn you that little boys can still `` shoot '' over the small guard . i am careful to position my little boy so that he is slightly leaning forward so that the `` projection path '' is downward . i have tried other seats with larger guards but these seem to sit too close and/or he easily removes them . this seat is a molded plastic and the guard is not removable . because this guard is not so large it would not get in the way of a little girl using this seat , too .
1	i received this stroller about a week ago , and so far , we love it . the ride is smooth , it 's very light , and i love the salmon color . the shade comes in handy , too . it has all the features i 'd want while still remaining ight and streamlined . it 's a little awkward to close , but i 'm a bit of a klutz , so i assume others might not have this problem . the handles are great , though , and they 're very comfortable for my husband ( 6 feet ) and me ( 5'7 '' . )
1	my son has colic and this blanket is a lifesaver ! when i wrap him in it , he falls asleep and stays asleep for long periods of time . he can easily break out of the swaddle me , but not the miracle blanket . i am going ot buy this product for all of my pregnant friends ! !
0	i do n't care what other reviewers say , but this bed rail sucked ! ! i used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed . it took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed . and it would constantly come unlocked . and if i buy another bed rail for our next child it wo n't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty . i ca n't remember if this cover was removable or not , if it was i 'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove
